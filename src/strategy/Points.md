### HAS-A can be better than IS-A

The HAS-A relationship is an interesting one: each duck
has a FlyBehavior and a QuackBehavior to which it
delegates flying and quacking.
When you put two classes together like this youâ€™re using
composition. Instead of inheriting their behavior, the
ducks get their behavior by being composed with the right
behavior object.

`Favor composition over inheritance.`

**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of
clients that use it.
